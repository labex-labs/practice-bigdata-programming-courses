The Big Data learning path involves mastering key technologies like Hadoop, Hive, and NoSQL databases. Hadoop provides a foundation for distributed storage and processing, while Hive allows SQL-like querying of large datasets. NoSQL databases enable scalable, flexible data storage. Continuous learning and hands-on practice with these tools are essential for mastering Big Data principles and practices.
